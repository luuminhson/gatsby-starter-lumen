I'm doing a job that people call 'Product Design'. Sometimes, what I've done are straightforward, the results are clear. But most of the times, it's a huge mess. To do what I want to do, I go through many things, many rounds of iteration and update, and of course, many failures - not all of them directly lead me to what I want to do from the beginning.
I travel from point A to point B, only to know B is not where I want to be. I get lost, only to understand that's the best way to the right destination. Things seem to be fine until I realize that I must redefine what I used to call "the right destination".

The struggles are real. If it's about myself, I could never do that - choose the way of a designer to solve life's problems. But like, I've never really chosen anything, things chose me. The only reason that makes me do what I do today as a designer, is the fact that I can contribute to something bigger than me, what I myself believe is meaningful.
But then, at the end of the day, I ask myself:
Why is design so hard?

Is it really need to be that hard? Is there something wrong?

It's funny that after some thoughts, I realize this maybe not a question about design. Tried my best not to turn myself to a philosopher, I couldn't help thinking it's rather a question about life.

Because design is life. Life has never been easy, either is design.

## Story about the stick

For human beings, to live is to design. We design to survive and to evolve.

The first thing human had ever designed should be a stick. A bone stick. One day in millions of years ago, one of our ancestors discovered that if he held an animal's bone, it's easier to hunt down his prey than using his bare hands. The bone is long, it can extend his field of attack. The bone is firm, it can cause the prey injury without hurting his hand. The bone stick soon became the most valuable tool in the tribe since they managed to have enough foods. After the food problem was solved, there was a new problem: territory. The population raised, human needed more land with better supplies. The stick had been designed to become a weapon - the weapon to fight with other tribes, and also to define who's the strongest to deserve most of the benefits.

Millions of years after, that stick had become spaceships, robots and artificial intelligence. We have designed the stick to get us more and more.

It's practical to mention that not only human know how to design. Other animals do. Birds know how to make a nest that can stand steadily in tree branches, shelter them during storms, helping them raise their newborns. Talking of nest, bees make it a whole new level. The beehive with the very complex structure is made to store bee's food: honey and pollen, housing the brood and more important, keeping the order when they work together. How are those not design?

Obviously, if there were no problem, there would be no design.

But where the problems come from?

Needs.

If there was no need, there was never a problem, ever.

Maybe I will not drill down to where all the needs come from. Somehow apparently, there are always needs for every species in this world, as long as they exist. And far beyond all species, human's needs are vast and endless. Complex yet simple enough, [Maslow's Hierachy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) can describe the human's needs thoroughly.

## Why design is so hard?

As a matter of fact, needs generate problems, we design solutions for a specific problem based on its root need. So, a good design is the design which solves the right need. Things happen that way for millions of years. What changed?

The reason why we still do design might not change, but everything else has changed, a lot.

* Before, when we did not have enough food, a design which brought us food efficiently was a good design. Nowadays, when you don't worry about starving, how is a design that brings food considered good?
* Before, when the need for communication at far distance arose, Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. Nowadays, with hundreds of smartphone brands, which ones have a good design?
* The first horseless, mechanized car was designed by Leonardo da Vinci in 1500s. Until 1600, the first car running by wind power was born. And 1769, the first steam-engined car. Today, how do you tell which has a better design between a luxury Roll-Royce and a Tesla electric car?

To answer the above questions is not the point. Everyone can tell: now we have thousands of needs, a good design is to solve the problem that generated by a specific need in certain contexts.

Bingo! What if the needs are not thousands, but millions, billions? Things get complicated. The problems that those needs generate are not in the same number, they are trillions. Because one problem can be generated by many needs, and one need can generate many problems. When you solve a problem for one need, you must make sure not to destroy other important needs in the same context. Just like that, you have a new design, an innovation. But:

This seems to be a weird question: why do you need to shampoo every day? With lots of people, shampooing or taking a bath is a must-have behavior daily, a standard. Who created and designed the shampoo or shower gel? Genius. But what was the standard of sanitary long before those inventions?

Since when don't you need for a personal car for daily transporting? At big cities, people mostly forgot about taxi, because of services like Uber, Lyft or Grab. All you need now is to pay.

What kind of company is that when you talk about Amazon? E-commerce, right? They used to sell books, then all stuff. But what about Amazon Web Service (AWS), one of the biggest services that provide cloud-computing platform? For what needs does Amazon design AWS?

Human will never run out of problems to solve, because they know how to generate needs after needs endlessly. Yet design may last long, but becomes harder and harder just because: we must define the problem to solve wisely. We already got to the point where the boundary between solutions and problems is erased. Soon there is no natural need to be fulfilled anymore, only the needs that we create ourselves. We design for the problems we don't have, generating from the non-existing or fast-changing needs. What people think they need today might be no longer tomorrow. Did you hear about Neuralink - a company of Elon Musk that develops a brain-machine interface to connect the human brain to computers? I believe that will be successful, and if it is, I doubt that Apple would continue to release new iPhones by 2025. For the change of the Internet or even our whole world after Neuralink succeeds, I cannot imagine.

In a world like this, what will we do as designers?

No, I don't think we should either try to become greatest designers, or lose all faith in the human future. But since design has become one of the most abstract work now, when we do design something, we should think as if we represent a species on this planet instead of a single person.
